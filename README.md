# Word researcher

The package aims to search a word inside a text. The tool is based on the KMP (Knuth–Morris–Pratt) algorithm.

The tool came with many features, like (findOne, findAll, history of search ...) and so many others, which some of them are already implemented, and the other will, soon.

Because of type's errors are the most common thing developers encounter and deal with, I have used typescript to implement the tool, which will make the tool more reliable to types.

## Installation

Use the package manager npm

```bash
npm install word-researcher
```

or for yarn

```bash
yarn add word-researcher
```

## Future features

For now, I 've just created the find method, and the history of search. I am aiming to include other features rather than the ones mentioned above. The new features will be described down below :

- Replacing the searched word in a text
- Highlighting the searched word in text
